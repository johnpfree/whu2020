    <description><![CDATA[<div dir="ltr">My plans got rained on :&lt;  <br>Pretty tasty Sunday breakfast at a local chain called Shari&apos;s.  The idea was to camp near Mt St Helens, and it was a cool drive to get there, but it was awfully gloomy and wet in the dark, dark forest where the campground was.  It was supposed to rain all night, and I just pussied out.  <br>I have gotten my truck camping act down pretty well, but that act is not rain-friendly.  I have to unload a bunch of boxes and bags from the back of the truck to make room for ME, and it is just a pain to have to cram them in the front of the truck, ... while it is raining.  So anyway, I pressed on to non-lovely Yakima for my appointment with the real Motel Hell...</div>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<div dir="ltr">wander, wander.   First good call was taking this Yakima Canyon cutoff, which was thirty miles of lovely volcanic canyon, with four BLM campgrounds that I want to come back to someday.  Got to see an osprey snag a trout out of the river just like on the Nature Channel.<br>That worked so well that I make a second, less good call to take a similar cutoff north to Wenatchee, but it got me to the Confluence Campground, so it all worked out.</div>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<div dir="ltr">Planned a meandering day.  I attempted to soak up downtown Wenatchee, but it was just another mid-sized traffic hell so I bailed, crossing the mighty Columbia to SR 12 south along the river. Quite a dramatic valley, even up here, I keep thinking about the giant lava flows 17 million years ago, then the hundreds of repeated giant floods ten thousand years ago. strains my geologic imagination actually.<br><br>Only real stop of the day was at the Wanapum Dam, with the Wanapum museum. They spoke well and sadly about the the Wanapums, who were peaceful and religious (whatever that means), and much too mellow to raise enough ruckus to get any kind of treaty or resettlement, so they are all but extinct. But anyway, at the edge of this giant hydroelectric dam is a lovely little 50&apos;s modern oasis of shade trees, a little fountain, overlook with binoculars, and a sweet little museum dedicated to the life and times of the last few Wanapums, in native garb sittin on 57 Chevies, singin songs, doing healing chants, weaving, the works.<br><br>Then I took a 80 mile route to get to a place 45 miles away, just because I&apos;ve never been here before. My route followed the north side of the Columbia, and on the south site was the Hanford Atomic Testing Site, which turns out to have been a top secret army base in WW2, where they made fissile material for the A bomb, what we call &quot;weapons-grade plutonium&quot; when the Koreans do it. There was an overlook where you could see the nuclear reactors still standing as they slowly try to decontaminate the place.</div>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<div dir="ltr">almost ran out gas, took a gamble that the town of Washtuchna would come through for me, and the Universe smiled on me (as opposed to laughing at me).  There was a cute little converted grain loading place with 8 cent cheaper gas, an espresso machine and biscotti, so I felt blessed.   <br>West of there, the countryside is fucking beautful.  Starts out being flat wheat fields, and slowly turns into rolling hills wheatfields, then there start being huge lodgepole pines in the valleys and around the farmhouses.  They looked odd and oddly magnificent being all dark and green and 100 feet tall against a backdrop of late-summer golden hills of wheat.  <br>They weren&apos;t quite harvesting, but they were getting ready.  The trucks and the threshers were parked all over the place, in standby mode.<br>Locally they call this area The Palouse.  It&apos;s lovely.</div>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<div dir="ltr">crazy little place - $8 for a tent site, but $5 extra if you want to use the bathroom.  The $13 total is still a great bargain for such a pretty well-appointed place, but it was just sooo weird.  <br>I mean, sitting right on the Salmon River on green grass with wifi and even electricity.  delightful, although Obama&apos;s speech tonight did occasion a rather spirited exchange of views between me and the proprietor.</div>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<div dir="ltr">breakfast at Hoot&apos;s Diner - excellent homemade sausage but a completely indifferent waitress who I had to go find in the kitchen to refill my coffee (Martha woulda died a thousand deaths if she was with me).  <br>The drive down the western edge of Idaho is really lovely.  First the wide-open mountain valleys, then the Salmon River valley through Riggins, then it gets less lovely at McCall, which is just another annoying yuppie getaway town.<br>Soon after, take a left at Banks to head into the Sawtooths.  It is of course the Friday of Labor Day, so the little mountain road is clogged with trailers and boats and everybody (including me) is crazy to get somewhere.</div>]]></description>

Some fine person had reserved a primo spot right on the creek for Sat and Sun, and since I only wanted to stay Friday, I got it!  <br>Most of the CG was filled with happy Mormon familys of innumerable blondes, who all seemed to know each other from last year, and who didn&apos;t want to know me.<br>The big attraction is a really nice hot spring up a short trail - 185 degrees coming out of the ground.  I lucked out again and went to it at what must be Mormon dinnertime, because I had the whole place to myself. I could not handle the main pool, I kept sticking my toesies in the pools farther and farther away until I was almost in the cold, cold river.</div>]]></description>

The one breakfast place had a huge line, the one bakery closed as I drove up to it.  Turns out I crossed a time zone yesterday - it&apos;s really 2pm here, not 1pm.  Actually the cuties at the bakery did sell me a YUMMY almond raspberry criossant and made me an americano, so I shouldn&apos;t bitch, I got a lotta love - I was just cranky.<br>Spent an hour at Cove Hot Spring, just little ole me sittin there in the hot water at the side of the river in my long sleeved shirt for an hour.<br>Stopped early for the night at a place that looked cool from the road.</div>]]></description>

Still though, I passed up an 11 mile detour to got to a wildlife refuge so I&apos;m definitely not on my game.  <br>Logan UT, home of the Utah State ??&apos;s.  They&apos;re got white students mowing the lawns!  So I think that definitely proves that all they got is white people in these parts!  Got an americano and chilled out awhile which finally kicked the headache.  I think it was a migraine.<br>The (pretty big) mountains between Bear Lake and Logan are made of limestone, which is what I grew up with in good ole Kentucky.

    <description><![CDATA[<div dir="ltr">12 mile drive from Wells up the mountain to get here, lovely little alpine lake with a bigass campground below it.  No shade - the ground is covered with aspens, but they are only 5 feet tall.   <br>Actually, in the late afternoon, the mountain makes some mega shade, but one definitely has to plan ones angles for when the sun comes blazing up the valley in the morning.  <br>Right before sunset I discovered the trail around the corner that gives a wonderful view of the Ruby Valley to the east and the Humboldt(?) Valley to the north.  Not sure it&apos;s still the humboldt this far east, but it&apos;s the big wide valley that I-80 runs through.</div>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<div dir="ltr">All I wanna do is take the scenic route to Lamoille, but the road trip gods are laughing at me today.  From 80 I see a wildfire in the distance, more or less where I and going.   I exit, drive 10 of the 11 miles of paved road I need to  get to the gravel cutoff to , and sure enough, there are flashing lights from every official vehicle in Elko who could get there quicker than me, and of course the road is closed till further notice, even though all it would take is closing the windows and driving through 20 yards of smoke to the other side.<br>So.. back to 80, drive through Elko and around for a 35 mile detour.  I passed the firetrucks on the way out, and by the time I got to Elko the smoke was gone, so maybe I shoulda waired...</div>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<div dir="ltr">always a winner.  because of all the detouring, it turns ut that I arrived at exactly the right time - 1pm checkout time.  So I snagged the cutest little campsite ever - #25, right on the creek, with privacy and a nice cozy feeling.  I have strong deja vu - have I camped here before?  Fiddle for a coupla hours, then drve to the end of the road for a hike, then back to good ole #25.<br></div>]]></description>
